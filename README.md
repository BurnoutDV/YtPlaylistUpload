# YtPlaylistUpload

## What is this?

I think i already lied when i title the thing. My original thought was to write some Python code that helps me uploading Youtube videos but of course this was already done a thousand times by people more competent than me. And Python is probably not the right language for that anyway.

So, change of plans.

What i want is a small program that helps me to keep track of my stuff. As i do mainly lets plays and spam that a lot i cannot say that i curate my individual videos a lot, sometimes i lose  track or stuff is just untidy cause i am distracted.

## Plans / Wants

* detect which new videos don't have a proper description
* detect which new videos are in no playlist
* detect if a playlist is not in order
* automatically add videos to playlist that have a specific tag

* Order playlist by itself, or if that fails, at least give directions which items are not where they are supposed to be

### Thoughts

Apparently its somewhat cumbersome to get any kind of access via the API calls, in my first preliminary trails it always wanted me to get a new access key via the browser, that was slightly annoying. If i cannot get this right i might want to do some kind of batch worker so i only need that to do once.
